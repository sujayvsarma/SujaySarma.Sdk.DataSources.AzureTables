# SujaySarma.Sdk.DataSources.AzureTables
The revamped SujaySarma.Sdk.DataSources.AzureTables library. We now use the SujaySarma.Sdk.Core as a submodule, this cleans up dependencies and also allows for a cleaner build and CI experience.

**NOTE:** Because there is no SujaySarma.Sdk.ObjectMapper library, we have one less dependency and only depend on the SujaySarma.Sdk.Core library!
